Hellooo out there! I'm currently working on a piece about the awesomeness that is Behavior Driven Development (BDD). I'll talk about the benefits and some cool BDD frameworks/libraries. If anyone has any thoughts on BDD that you'd like to contribute, feel free to reach out to me at [olydevops@gmail.com](mailto:olydevops@gmail.com).
