Some wise folks once told me that "fun is a force multiplier."

This is so true! It doesn't take an engineer or a social psychologist to explain that when people are having fun they can accomplish more. For me, I often perform better talking through a problem with a co-worker than working in my own bubble. This depends on the nature of the work, my mood, and more...but it's true more often than not.

Deploying code feels good. I always feel accomplished when, at the end of a sprint, I can tag and push a commit and sit back knowing that my code is well-tested and ready to go. There's something about delivering a finished feature or fix that is just excellent. Working together to build software is great - especially when that software is a moving part in an effort to help the folks we work each day to serve.

So...make every deployment a celebration. Wear a funny hat, or play an upbeat song, or high five your teammates. Whatever you do, don't diminish that win! You accomplished something and that is awesome.
