## Who am I?

I'm on a mission to make things better one software product at a time. I feel passionately that software produced by government agencies, nonprofits, and social enterprises should be modern, accessible, and secure. I also feel strongly that teams in these organizations should be provided with the support they need to be happy, collaborative, and productive while building products that make an impact.

I have spent time as an engineer of all trades, a helpdesk technician, a scrummaster, and a business analyst - among other roles. I live to make processes around me more efficient, to reduce waste, and to have more fun in the process.

Let's modernize together.
